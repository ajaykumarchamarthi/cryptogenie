      "Most AI/ML predictions are black boxes. One cannot interpret or understand the predictions made by the models. Our models have been built using interpretable and inclusive features that produce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of prediction performance. We achieve this by extracting features that explain the underlying model classification across our asset universe.",

      "We have developed a state of the art end-to-end architecture for delivering high quality predictions seamlessly and continuously. Our infrastructure takes care of data ingest, validation, transformation, feature extraction and prediction automatically. It is designed to be secure, scalable and resilient. We regularly work on improving the concept so that we can deploy newer and better models.",
